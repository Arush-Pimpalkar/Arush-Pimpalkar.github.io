            <p id="venn-description-body">
              My research unites neuroscience, robotics, and human-centered
              design to create neural interfaces that restore and enhance
              function. By combining insights into brain–body signaling with
              soft robotic devices and a rigorous focus on usability, I aim to
              develop technologies that not only advance science and engineering
              but also translate seamlessly into everyday clinical care.

        <!-- <h2>Peripheral Neural Interfaces for Restorative Medicine</h2>
        <p>
          My work explores how we can interface with the peripheral nervous
          system to restore and modulate complex functions affected by injury or
          disease. From building finger rehabilitation robots to developing
          neural interfaces for cancer treatment, I design bioelectronic tools
          that engage peripheral nerves in targeted, minimally invasive ways.
          This includes non-invasive feedback systems for motor recovery and
          implantable devices for neuromodulation, all aimed at advancing
          personalized and accessible therapies.
        </p>
        <h2>Bidirectional Interfaces for Human-Robot Teaming</h2>
        <p>
          I build systems that treat human-machine interaction as a two-way
          conversation. My research focuses on designing perceptually
          calibrated, multimodal feedback interfaces — including soft haptic
          actuators and biomimetic tactile sensors — that communicate
          information back to the user in natural, intuitive ways. By studying
          how sensory cues guide action, I aim to create robotic systems that
          not only respond to human intent but also shape it through real-time
          feedback, supporting dexterity, rehabilitation, and adaptive control.
